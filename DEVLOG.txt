  Made small addition to prevent players from choosing the same colors. 

1-17-22 9:17 pm : Derrick, Rayyan
  Began implementing the path displayer to show players where they can move their piece to. Still faulty.
  Fixed and added to Hex* get_corner_array and Hex* neighbor.

1-18-22 10:28 pm: Derrick, Rayyan
  Tried running the game.
  Noticed errors with board display, quitting the game, and game over.

1-18-22 1:12 pm : Rayyan
  Fixed bug with path displayer that would show the player the wrong spot.
  Fixed Hex move_cursor in order to allow players the move to available spots across the board.

1-19-22 8:04 pm : Steven
  Updated README to include the online sources used

1-19-22 3:00 pm: Derrick, Rayyan
  Expanded code to allow six players to pick their color and name themselves
  Implemented the map being changed depending on # of players.
  Updated menu to make it more clear you cant choose same color.

1-20-22 1:32 pm: Steven, Derrick
  Began trying socket features with UI2.

1-21-21 3:04 am: Steven, Rayyan
  Implemented going over other pieces.
  Added on to the possible path displayer to show where you can go over pieces as well.
  Touched up on the menu to make it look better.

1-22-21 8:07 pm: Rayyan, Derrick, Steven
  Added onto project for when the game ends. Brings user back to menu after a win. 
  * Now need to try implementing server with sockets and music

1-23-21 10:44 pm : Steven
  Tried implementing multiplayer server with sockets and pipes. Below is attempted process
    * 'netcat' is started up in the background listening for the TCP connection on Port 5555 (that's what argumnets -l -p 5555 are doing), and it's stdin/stdout are connected to pipes: pipe1 and pipe2
  * game process is also started and it's stdout/stdin are also connected to pipe1 and pipe2
  * multiplayer needs to be further worked on

  Quitting noise causes terminal to crash.
  
1-24-22 10:47 am : Steven, Derrick, Rayyan
  First practice run on school computers.
  Had trouble with ncurses and sound files on school computers.
  Fixed the ncurse errors with slight change to makefile to allow it to compile on linux.

1-24-22 9:15 pm : Steven, Derrick
  Changed sound library to be compatible for Linux. 
  
1-24-22 10:09 pm : Rayyan
  Tried fixing error with quitting noise breaking the terminal. Did not succeed :(

  Edited README file to have the final requirements and use markdown and organized it

1-25-22 1:56 am : Rayyan
  Edited README because added a space after ** by accident messing up the formatting

1-26-22 10:34 am : Steven, Rayyan , Derrick
  Made changes fix sound not working on linux. Still need to fix the quitting game sound breaking the game. 
  (Mr. DW is testing the code on school computers, so we do not need to worry about sound not being compatible with ssh). 
  
1-26-22 12:41 pm : Steven

1-26-22 1:07 pm : Steven, Derrick, Rayyan
